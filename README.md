## Augur
Augur is a decentralized prediction market platform that runs on [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org). For a detailed, high-level explanation of how Augur works, please refer to the [Augur whitepaper](http://www.augur.net/whitepaper.pdf).

If you want to use or help test Augur, please install the [Augur App](https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-app). If you want to use our cutting-edge development client, this is maintained at [https://dev.augur.net](https://dev.augur.net). However, be warned – we push changes here pretty rapidly, so it can be a bit buggy!

Augur has its own dedicated [Stack Exchange](https://augur.stackexchange.com), which allows anyone to ask questions about Augur and get answers to those questions. It’s a great resource to find the answers for questions you might have that aren’t answered directly in these documents. Additionally, you can chat with us on [Discord](https://discordapp.com).
